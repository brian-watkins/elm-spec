{-| A `Witness` can be used to record information about the arguments passed to
a `Cmd`-generating function.

If you use dependency inversion to decouple part of your program from the
`Cmd`-generating functions it depends upon, you can use a `Witness` to prove that this
part of your program works with the `Cmd`-generating function in the right way.

Let's say I have a `Cmd`-generating function that takes a score (an `Int`) and saves
it to the server via some HTTP request. Let's further suppose I want to describe the behavior
of my user interface, without worrying about the details of how a score is saved. In this
case, I'll 'inject' the `Cmd`-generating function instead of calling it directly from my update
function. This allows me to substitute a fake function during my spec.

Here's the update function:

    update : (Int -> Cmd Msg) -> Msg -> Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)
    update scoreSaver msg model =
      case msg of
        SaveScore score ->
          ( model, scoreSaver score )
        ...

Now, I can write a spec that uses a witness to record the score passed to the injected
`scoreSaver` function like so:

    Spec.describe "saving the score"
    [ Spec.scenario "successful save" (
        Spec.given (
          Spec.Setup.init (App.init testFlags)
            |> Spec.Setup.withView App.view
            |> Witness.forUpdate (\witness ->
              App.update <| \score ->
                Witness.record "saved-score"
                  (Json.Encode.int score) witness
            )
        )
        |> Spec.when "the score is saved"
          [ Spec.Markup.target << by [ id "game-over-button" ]
          , Spec.Markup.Event.click
          ]
        |> it "saves the proper score" (
          Witness.observe "saved-score" (Json.Decode.int)
            |> Spec.expect (Spec.Claim.isListWhere
              [ Spec.Claim.isEqual Debug.toString 28
              ]
            )
        )
      )
    ]
